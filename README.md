Weekly labs from Stanford-offered Coursera Machine Learning Course. -- Professor: Andrew Ng. -- Language: Octave

Oactave and Matlab are both compatible for these labs.

 - Course Description

This online course offers wide range of machine learning topics that I could grasp as a beginner:

  Week 1: Linear Regression with One Variable<br>
  Week 2: Linear Regression with Multiple Variables<br>
  Week 3: Logistic Regression<br>
  Week 4: Multi-class ClassiÔ¨Åcation and Neural Networks<br>
  Week 5: Neural Networks Learning<br>
  Week 6: Regularized Linear Regression and Bias v.s. Variance<br>
  Week 7: Support Vector Machines<br>
  Week 8: K-means Clustering and Principal Component Analysis<br>
  Week 9: Anomaly Detection and Recommender Systems<br>
  Week 10: Large Scale Machine Learning<br>
  Week 11: Application Example: Photo OCR

 - Motivation 

After completing AP Computer Science A course last year, I wanted to challenge myself even more and 
explore through complex computer science topics that I recently became fascinated about as a robot-enthusiant: machine learning.

Despite not being able to comprehend every complex machine learning concepts, I hope my completion of this course is a good start for 
onboarding AI field.

 - What I learned / plans to do next 
 
 Through this course/labs, I not only learned abstract machine learning concepts, but also real-life impactful applications 
 of these concepts that has not been fully developed yet: self-driving cars, medical diagnosis, online-fraud detection, etc.
 
 Thus, intrigued to utilize the knowledge I gained from this course, I plan to create my personal project that I will work on
 for the rest of myy junior year: self-driving toy car.
